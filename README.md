# Minesweeper

C++ and SFML-based Minesweeper game. Can you play this classic?

Unfortunately, I have switched to Mac and am unable to change anything or even test this game. Currently, I am stuck with a not-so-nice difficulty and board size. If you are a Windows User, you can tweak and modify the code.

Have fun!
