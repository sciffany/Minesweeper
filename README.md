# Minesweeper

C++ and SFML-based Minesweeper game. Can you play this classic?

## Running the program

### Windows
  Run `mines.exe` file

### Mac

  I am currently finding a good IDE to revive this project which was developed on Windows.

## Modifying Board Size

While I am still unable to rebuild this program, you can modify the `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` variables in `mines.cpp` file and recompile using your IDE of choice.
